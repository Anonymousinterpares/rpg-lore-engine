You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scion with a lingering sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your estate, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.",

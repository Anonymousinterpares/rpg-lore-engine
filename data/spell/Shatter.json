Each creature has a sphere with a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a constitution saving throw or it suffers 3d8 thunder damage. If successful, the damage is halved. A creature made of inorganic materials such as stone, crystal or metal, makes its saving throw with a disadvantage.\nA non-magical item that is not worn or carried also suffers damage if it is in the area of the spell.",

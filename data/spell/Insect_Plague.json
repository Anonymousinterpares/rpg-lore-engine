The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere's area is difficult terrain.\nWhen the area appears, each creature in it must make a constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.",

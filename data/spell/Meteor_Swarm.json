Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.\nThe spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.",

If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a charisma saving throw.\n- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.\n- Targets within the cylinder can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.",
